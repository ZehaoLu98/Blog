# Introduction

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool that brings Claude's capabilities directly to your terminal. One of its most powerful features is **Skills** — custom instructions that extend Claude's behavior for specific tasks. In this post, I'll explain how skills work and how to create your own.

## What Are Skills?

Skills are markdown files that provide Claude with specific instructions for performing tasks. Think of them as reusable prompts that you can invoke with a simple slash command.

:::tip
Skills let you codify your team's best practices and coding standards into reusable templates.

# Anatomy of a Skill

## File Structure

Skills live in the `.claude/skills/` directory of your project:

```
.claude/
└── skills/
    ├── create-blog/
    │   └── SKILL.md
    ├── create-skill/
    │   └── SKILL.md
    └── python-script/
        └── SKILL.md
```

:::note
Each skill should be in its own directory, with the markdown file matching the directory name.
:::

## Skill Format

Every skill file has two parts:

### 1. Frontmatter

The YAML frontmatter at the top defines metadata:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of what this skill does.
---
```

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `name` | The command name (matches filename) |
| `description` | Explains when Claude should use this skill |

### 2. Instructions

The body contains markdown instructions that Claude follows when the skill is invoked:

```markdown
---
name: python-script
description: When writing Python scripts, always include author information.
---

When writing a Python script, always include:

1. **Shebang line**: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
2. **Author block**: Name, email, date, description
3. **Type hints**: Add type annotations where appropriate

## Template

\```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Author: Your Name
Email: your@email.com
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Description: What this script does
"""
\```
```

# Using Skills

## Invoking a Skill

To use a skill, simply type the slash command in Claude Code:

```bash
/python-script
```

Claude will then follow the instructions defined in that skill for subsequent tasks.

## Example Workflow

1. You type: `/python-script`
2. Claude loads the skill instructions
3. You ask: "Write a script to parse CSV files"
4. Claude generates code following your skill's template (with author info, type hints, etc.)

:::important
Skills are project-specific. Place them in each repository where you want them available.
:::

# Creating Your Own Skills

## Step 1: Create the Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/my-skill
```

## Step 2: Write the Skill File

Create `.claude/skills/my-skill/my-skill.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Describe when this skill should be used.
---

# Instructions

Your detailed instructions here...

## Guidelines

- Guideline 1
- Guideline 2

## Example

Show an example of the expected output.
```

## Step 3: Test It

Run `/my-skill` in Claude Code and verify it behaves as expected.

# Best Practices

:::tip
Keep skills focused on a single task. Create multiple small skills rather than one large one.
:::

## Do's

- **Be specific**: Clear instructions produce consistent results
- **Include examples**: Show Claude exactly what you expect
- **Use formatting**: Headers, lists, and code blocks improve readability
- **Keep it concise**: Shorter skills are easier to maintain

## Don'ts

- Don't include sensitive information (API keys, passwords)
- Don't make skills too broad or generic
- Don't forget to test after changes

# Practical Use Cases

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `create-blog` | Generate blog posts with proper frontmatter |
| `python-script` | Ensure scripts have author headers |
| `review-code` | Standardize code review feedback |
| `write-tests` | Follow testing conventions |
| `commit` | Generate consistent commit messages |

:::note
Skills work best when they encode patterns you repeat frequently.
:::

# Conclusion

Claude Code skills are a simple but powerful way to customize Claude's behavior for your specific workflows. By creating skills for your common tasks, you can:

- Ensure consistency across your codebase
- Save time on repetitive instructions
- Share best practices with your team

Start with one or two skills for tasks you do daily, and expand from there. The investment in creating good skills pays off quickly in productivity gains.
